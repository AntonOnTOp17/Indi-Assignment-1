			&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe one of my main hobbies as of late has been reading. Books have been a cornerstone of my academic growth, expanding my knowledge beyond the classroom and deepening my understanding of various subjects. 
			They have sharpened my critical thinking, broadened my perspective, and fueled my curiosity, helping me develop the skills necessary to excel academically.
			</br><br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp; I have never been a fan of studying and always ended up finding other sources of leisure to endulge in but I truly believe that reading helped me to still
			perform well academically. I sat my CSEC examinations last year July and I vividly remember my mom worrying because I wasn't studying (In the same manner from when I sat 
			GSAT all those years ago). However I wasn't worried, I was calm because I began reading "The 48 Laws of Power" by Robert Greene at the time and simply just did my exams
			without a worry. On August 24, 2023, my results became public and I got:

			&nbsp;&nbsp;I always say to myself that if I were to have spent my time studying and put pressure on myself instead doing something I enjoyed, I would not have
			achieved the results I did. Reading serves as my personal escape from the pressures and also helps to clear my mind of all things unneeded at the moment. Reading 
			helps me relax by allowing me to escape into different worlds, shift my focus, and unwind from daily stress. It calms my mind, promotes a sense of peace, and offers 
			a mental break, leaving me refreshed and recharged. I'll end this with a quote from J.K. Rowling which states <q><i>If you don't like to read, You Haven't found the right 
			book.</i></q>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think I have anybody I could say I view as a hero but a fictional character's personality and idealogy I found really cool is that of <b>Escanor's.</b>
			Escanor is the lion sin of pride from the popular anime called "<i>The Seven Deadly Sins</i>".His entire persona is centered around being egotistical and over-confident 
			regardless of the situation at hand which leads to intresting dialogue and a sense of hype as a viewer. The quote that truly made me a fan of his character was stated
			while he was battling a demon who turns anyone who says a lie in his vicinity to stone. The quote states:
		
		</p>
		
		<br/>
		
		<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:20px">
			<b>
				<i>
					"I am a human but,<br/>
					I'm also the one that stands at the pinnacle of all races."
				</i>
			</b>
		</p>
		
		<br/>
		<br/>
		
		
		<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:20px">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;This simple quote was truly so surreal to me when I first watched the episode it aired in and even motivated me to begin reading the manga of which the anime
			was adapted off. To think that a mere human would face a being of a more powerful race and say something so boisterous in a situation where he cannot lie and still leave
			unscathed.<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;I chose Escanor due to how his unwavering confidence can be used as motivation in real world to not falter in the face of adversity.A mindset which believes
			defeat is not an option will never truly be defeated. Even in my academics I try to always be confident going into any exam or into any assignment and just focus on doing
			my best instead of being the best.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the results of the personality test when it comes to my indiviudiual characteristics. Seeing that I gave such a good depection of my 
			personality I would believe that it would be somewhat valid in general as well.
