			&nbsp;&nbsp;The premise of the book is that a young guy has a conversation with a maintenance man who 
			works the grounds of a rich family. The maintenance man tells him that if he wants to have 
			a good life, he must follow these twelve pillars. At the end of the book, it turns out that the
			groundskeeper is actually the wealthy man who owns the property. The main pull of the book however 
			can be found in it's clever means of incorparating real life lessons into the story being built upon.

			Chapter 4: Achieve Your Goals
		</h2>
		
		<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:20px">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;In the book, Rohn shares pretty solid advice for setting a major goal and then breaking it down into smaller, more achievable goals.
			But the first step to achieving your goals is to decide what you want and then write it down. We’ve talked about goal setting before
			and how fundamental principles are a roadmap for your life. It’s important to put together a plan so you can follow it. 
			<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;I always tend to stray from the main task at hand when doing assignments. It may be something like fixating on an aspect of it which
			does not warrant that much attention or simply getting lost on social media after taking a "short" break. This chapter provides a means to how I 
			can better focus on my goals (in this case my assignments) and how I can better manage time by writing down smaller portions of the task to finish
			them more effectively.

			Chapter 5: The Proper Use of Time
		</h2>
		
		<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:20px">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;This chapter was mainly focused around the importance of proper time mananagement in our lives. The chapter highlights a powerful life lesson
			about the importance of pursuing your dreams and not letting fear hold you back. It reminded me that life is short, and the end comes sooner than we often
			realize. Many people never allow themselves to dream, and even when they do, they often don't take action to make those dreams a reality. As a result, they 
			may reach the end of their lives filled with regret, knowing they didn’t do what they truly wanted to.
			<br/>	
			&nbsp;&nbsp;The text encouraged me to overcome my fears and work
			toward the things I longedd for, so that when my time comes, I can look back with satisfaction rather than sorrow. It’s a reminder to live fully and intentionally,
			seizing opportunities before it’s too late and not be too troubled about the possible burdens of life.

			Chapter 6: Surround Yourself With the Best People
		</h2>
		
		<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:20px">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;This chapter offers an important life lesson about the influence of the people we surround ourselves with. It emphasizes that those closest to us—whether
			friends, family, or colleagues—have a significant impact on our values, habits, and ultimately our destiny. By associating with people who embody the qualities and 
			skills we want to develop, we can positively shape our own growth. The key takeaway is to regularly evaluate the people in our lives by asking how they influence our
			thoughts, actions, and future potential, and to consider whether these influences are aligned with our personal goals and values. 
			<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, your attitude is heavily influenced by the people around you which you associate with.Your attitude is a reflection of the company you keep.
			Surround yourself with positive, driven, and uplifting people, and you’ll find that their energy fuels your own growth and success. When you align with those who 
			inspire you, they push you to become your best self. Remember, the right people in your life can help shape your mindset and attitude, leading you to greater
			achievements and fulfillment. Choose your circle wisely, because their influence can either lift you higher or hold you back.

			Chapter 7: Be a Life-Long Learner
		</h2>
		
		<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:20px">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;This chapter presents a key life lesson about the importance of self-education beyond formal schooling. While formal education provides valuable knowledge
			and a foundation for making a living, true success comes from continuous self-directed learning. Many people complete their education only to live unfulfilled lives,
			as Thoreau suggests, with untapped potential. The text emphasizes that lifelong learning is essential for personal growth, wealth, health, and spiritual development.
			Formal education may end, but true success comes from a commitment to self-education, which allows individuals to adapt, grow, and lead fulfilling lives. The author
