				Theme of Website
			</u>
		</h1>
		
		<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:20px">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;The theme was a very minimalistic design with a dark and limited color palette. The main color of the website is RGB(54,54,54) aka mid grey with the main
			complimenting colors being white and black. All documents created by me which were used on the website also had a background of the same RGB value which gave the image 
			a more natural borderless look.<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;The font usage was mainly duopoly of Courier New and Times New Roman due to simple and well known nature. I tried my best to keep the 
			document simple and to mainly follow a manner in which simply scrolling down gives access to all information on the webpage. The main target audience would mainly be 
			whomever is grading this assignment and a few friends who are also pursuing a career in the same field to showcase my improved web development skills seeing that I was 
			a begineer.
